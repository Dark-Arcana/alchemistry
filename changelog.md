# Alchemistry 1.18.2-2.2.1 Release

This release backports the 1.19.x sided configuration feature. Barring any major issues, this should be the last version to be released for 1.18.

Changes:
- Update Forge, ChemLib, AlchemyLib.
- Backport sided configuration from 1.19.x.
- Fix JEI issue when using JEI 10 where fluids weren't shown properly in recipes. This change means that you will be required to use JEI 10, as the plugin refactor isn't compatible with older versions.
