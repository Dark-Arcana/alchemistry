# Alchemistry 1.19.2-2.2.4 RELEASE

This update was a long time coming. It addresses a few common issues. Most changes were done in AlchemyLib and ChemLib.

Changes:
- Update ChemLib, AlchemyLib, and Forge.
- AlchemyLib update adds sidedness to InventoryBlockEntities like the Dissolver, Combiner, and Compactor such that they now only accept input on the top and west side of the block and output on the bottom and east side of the block. This way your inputs and outputs aren't mixed up.
- Minor changes to the Dissolver's logic to try to make it lag less.

Fixes:
- Fix combiner input (I think?).
