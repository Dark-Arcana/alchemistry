# Alchemistry 1.19.2-2.3.0 RELEASE

Thanks for everyone's patience with this update. I've been quite busy this year, so the rate of new updates has stalled considerably. However, thanks to the help of a community member @Geolykt, Alchemistry now has support for properly setting what each side of a machine does. You can also automatically pull and eject from and to connected containers!

Changes:
- Update AlchemyLib.
- AlchemyLib update adds sidedness to InventoryBlockEntities like the Dissolver, Combiner, and Compactor such that allows a user to determine what each side of the block can be used for. It can either be Enabled, Disabled, Push, or Pull. Pushing and pulling works for all connected containers.
