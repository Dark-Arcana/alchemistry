# Alchemistry 1.19.2-2.2.0 BETA

This is a fairly substantial update under the hood. It shouldn't change anything with how you play the game. I split the api directory out into its own mod so that it can be used by other mods as a library.

- Split the api directory into a separate library and update everything accordingly.
- Get rid of magic anotations for events.
