# Alchemistry 1.18.2-2.2.1 Release

This should backport features from 1.19.x that were updated in ChemLib and AlchemyLib. There might not be any more updates for 1.18.x moving forward if there are no major issues with this update. Let me know!

Changes:
- Update Forge, ChemLib, AlchemyLib.
- Update mods.toml requirements.
- Refactor to account for AlchemyLib changes.
- Refactor CombinerBlockEntity#initializeInputHandler#isItemValid from previous PR to be cleaner.
- Move ru_ru lang file to correct place, PR put it in the wrong spot.
